        <p>It's close to midnight
            And something evil's lurking in the dark
            Under the moonlight
            You see a sight that almost stops your heart
            You try to scream
            But terror takes the sound before you make it
            You start to freeze
            As horror looks you right between the eyes
            You're paralyzed
            'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
            And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
            You know it's thriller, thriller night
            You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
            Ooh, ooh
            You hear the door slam
            And realize there's nowhere left to run
            You feel the cold hand
            And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
            You close your eyes
            And hope that this is just imagination
            Girl, but all the while
            You hear a creature creepin' up behind
            You're out of time
            'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
            There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
            Thriller, thriller night
            You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
            Night creatures call
            And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
            There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
            This is the end of your life, ooh
            They're out to get you
            There's demons closin' in on every side
            They will possess you
            Unless you change that number on your dial
            Now is the time
            For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
            All through the night
            I'll save you from the terror on the screen
            I'll make you see
            That this is thriller, thriller night
            'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
            Thriller, thriller night
            So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
            Chiller, thriller here tonight
            'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
            Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
            Thriller, thriller night
            So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
            I'm gonna thrill you tonight
            Darkness falls across the land
            The midnight hour is close at hand
            Creatures crawl in search of blood
            To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
            And whosoever shall be found
            Without the soul for getting down
            Must stand and face the hounds of hell
            And rot inside a corpse's shell
            I'm gonna thrill you tonight
            Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
            I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
            Thriller, all night, oh baby
            I'm gonna thrill you tonight
            Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
            I'm gonna thrill you tonight
            Thriller, all night (oh baby)
            Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
            The foulest stench is in the air
            The funk of forty thousand years
            And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
            Are closing in to seal your doom
            And though you fight to stay alive
            Your body starts to shiver
            For no mere mortal can resist
            The evil of the thriller</p>
